here we have two schemas 
1) threads means complete chat msg and reply 
2)msg schema 
1) thread schema 
complete msg reply msg reply of one entire chat is one thread
individal chat sequence
to store all threads we have created thread schema :individal thread /individal chat history 

threadid,title ,msg,created at,updated ait 

2) msgs schema
content ,role=>user,assistant , timestamp ;



routes :
get/thread: all threads infromations  stores like updated at (most recent chat at top and)
get/thread/:threadid => get the threads by id 
delete /thread/:threadid=> delete a specific thread 
post /chat => ask the assistant
 -> message to frontend
 ->backend reply pair 
this post is important 


post imagine =>
post/api/chat with thread id and message send to the backend from frontend
based on this we are going to create the information 
1) validate the threadid ,message 
2) two possible cases for the thread id 
already exist or new one 
check whether thread  id is part of the database or not if not create a new threadid
3)store the message in the thread
4) we will get the response 
backend calls the open ai api it will reply the backend 
5)db will store the reply generated by the assistant

frontend -> creates a postrequest->validates the threadid ,message by backend if exist ok not create a thread and store -> ask the openapi get answer store in the thread and send as reply to the frontend
